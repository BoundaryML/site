## BAML Chat

Learning a new Domain Specific Language (DSL) might seem daunting at first, but it doesn't have to be.

Introducing BAML Chatâ€¦

You can now ask our chatbot any question and it has the ability to:
1. **Create BAML code** for problems like "How do I extract a resume" (including test cases!)
2. **Migrate** from LangChain, OpenAI, or any other toolchain to BAML
3. **Generate examples** of TypeScript / Python code that uses BAML code
4. **Ask clarifying questions** about our docs

Here's the AI bot **searching our documentation:**

Or showing us **how to use a prompting technique** using BAML:

<Video src="/launchweekAssets/day2-use-article.mp4" />

As well as helping us **write a chatbot:**

<Video src="/launchweekAssets/day2-chatbot-tools.mp4" />

And more! There may be one day where you may no longer need to browse documentation, and AI agents like this can help you answer *your* specific questions for *your* use case.

That said, this is an AI bot that is currently in Beta (but we'll be continuing to improve it). You always have the option to message us on our Discord! **98% of messages get replied within the same day.**

And don't forget, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/yzaTpQ3tdT) community - we'll be there to answer any LLM or prompting questions that you have!
