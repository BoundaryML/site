<Tip title="Pre-reading: What is structured generation?">
Structured generation is the idea of coercing the LLM to generate some
data that you can parse into a data model and then programatically
use.
</Tip>

The most common way to extract structured data / do function calling out of an LLM is to somehow get the LLM to output JSON, and then call `JSON.parse`.

However, there is no reason to assume that JSON, the prevalant serialization for Web APIs, should be the ideal serialization for LLMs. Given the stochastic nature of LLMs, it might even be true that all strict serialization formats are suboptimal, since a single error can cause the entire serialization to be invalid.

In this article, we'll:

1. Explain how every current technique of structured data extraction works
2. Discuss the pros and cons of each technique
3. Introduce a new technique, SAP (Schema-Aligned Parsing), that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (Jump to [SAP](#sap))

Since Function calling requiring training a model on the special <code>USE_TOOL</code> token, it was not previously supported by all providers. As it is more common, and the interface is becoming more standardized, I've warmed up to it. However, I still have a few reservations:<ol><li>Function calling suffers from the same schema inaccuracy JSON mode does. <code>{'{'} "foo": 1 {'}'}</code> is valid JSON, but if you wanted <code>{'{'} "foo": int[] {'}'}</code>, it would be close, but still wrong.</li><li>Most APIs rely on a JSON schema, which is incredibly wasteful in the token space.</li><li>A lot of models still don't support it</li><li>Models that do support it often have degraded accuracy with function calling when compared to just prompting based techniques.</li></ol>That said, it does overcome some of the key problems with JSON mode like supporting verbosity-based techniques.

<div id="llm-retries">
<SapTechniqueTitle title="LLM Retries" type="parser" count={6} takeaways={{score: 1, notes: <>This is the only technique on here that I think has a potential to be a game changer, but is currently not used in an interesting way.<br/><br/>Today, many libraries are treating an LLM like a hammer and throwing every problem its way. <code>JSON.parse</code> failed due to including a comment? a trailing comma? Ask the LLM to fix the error and try parsing again.<br/><br/>

<b>This adds unbounded latency and costs to the system.</b> LLMs are already slow and expensive (albiet getting cheaper and faster, but still significantly slower than most software).<br/><br/>


Where I see potential, however, is in more complex systems to fix logical inconsistencies. An LLM is likely the only approach for doing this at scale. For example, fixing a scenario where age was off by 3 years.
<pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap">{`
// Data model
class Person {
  name string
  job string
  birth_year int
  age int @assert(
    this == now().year - birth_year,
    "{this} doesn't match {birth_year} given {now().year}"
  )
}

// To fix it, instead of giving the LLM everything (the entire data model), just give it the error and only the properties that are relevant to age.
{
  "error": "age=30 doesn't match birth_year=1990 given now.year=2024",
  "birth_year": 1990,
  "age": 30
}
`
}</pre>

Current approaches, would likely just retry the entire model, but a more sophisticated approach would be to only give the LLM the error and the relevant properties, reducing costs and latencies. This would be a much more efficient approach, but would require a lot of engineering (and compilers) to get right.

<div className="flex flex-col gap-1">Retry the model until it produces something that is parseable or pass parsing errors to the model and hope that when it tries again, you can get good results.

This was one of the few ideas I've seen which step away from JSON, XML, and other similar formats and tries to reframe the problem in a way the LLM may better understand. <b>The issue with generating code, is that code, like JSON, is still a very strict grammar.</b> While code has very few superfluous tokens (like <code>:</code> or <code>"</code> in JSON), you still rely on a parser you often don't own (the syntax parser of the language).

<Tip title="Note">We don't use json_schema for SAP, instead we use baml_schema, which is a more compressed way to define schemas. This is because we don't need to be as strict as JSON during parsing so we can omit characters like quotes. You can read more here: <a href="/blog/type-definition-prompting-baml">Your prompts are using 4x more tokens than they need.</a></Tip>
</>}}>
<div className="flex flex-col gap-1">Instead of relying on the model to strictly understand our desired format, write a parser that generously reads the output text and applies error correction techniques with knowledge of the original schema.</div>
</SapTechniqueTitle>

## What is SAP and why does it work so well?

The key idea behind SAP is to assume that the model will make mistakes, and to build a parser that is robust enough to handle them. This would be virtually impossible for some tasks, but in the context of structured data extraction, we have a schema to guide us. A key inspiration to us was Postel's Law, coined by Jon Postel, the creator of TCP/IP:

> Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.

We'll do a future post that outlines exactly how our SAP algorithm works. At a very high-level, you can think of the leetcode problem "Edit Distance" but instead of comparing two strings, we ask: "What is least cost edit I need to make to get from the model's output to something parseable by a schema?" The simplest cost function could be Levenshtein distance, but we use a custom cost function that takes into account the schema. (The code is open-source, so you can check it out [here](https://github.com/boundaryml/baml))

Meanwhile, here are three examples to show some of the error correction techniques we use:
<SapWhatIsSAP />
</div>

Some more error correction techniques we use in SAP include:

- Unquoted strings
- Unescaped quotes and new lines in strings
- Missing commas
- Missing colons
- Missing brackets
- Misnamed keys
- Cast fractions to floats
- Remove superfluous keys in objects
- Strip yapping
- Picking the best of many possible candidates in case LLM produces multiple outputs
- Complete partial objects (due to streaming)
- and more

## Using SAP today

We wanted to offer SAP in all languages of your choice, so we've written it in Rust and provide a native interface for Python, Typescript, and Ruby. (We're working on more languages, but we're a small team!)

Since all interfaces use the same Rust code, you can expect the same performance and accuracy across all languages.

You can try it on our online playground: [https://promptfiddle.com](https://promptfiddle.com) or add it to your code base already. ([Go to documentation](https://docs.boundaryml.com/docs/get-started/quickstart/python))

### Code Snippet

1. Write a schema in BAML

```baml
// my_app/baml_src/my_schema.baml
class Resume {
  name string @description("first and last name")
  email string?
  experience Experience[]
}

class Experience {
  title string
  company string
}
```

2. Write an LLM prompt in BAML

```baml
// my_app/baml_src/my_schema.baml
// ...

function ExtractResume(text: string) -> Resume {
  client "openai/gpt-4o"
  prompt #"
    Describe this resume.
    {{ ctx.output_format }}

    {{ _.role('user') }}
    {{ text }}
  "#
}
```

3. Create bindings in your language of choice and use the BAML defined function as if it were a native function (with autocomplete and types!).

### Python
```bash
$ pip install baml-py
$ baml-cli generate --from /path/to/my_schema.baml --target "python/pydantic"
```

```python
from baml_client import b

# resume will always be a Pydantic model of type Resume
resume = b.ExtractResume("""
  Vaibhav Gupta
  vbv@boundaryml.com
  - Founder @ BoundaryML
""")

# BAML will automatically validate the response via SAP and cast it to a Pydantic model
```


### Typescript
```bash
$ npm install @boundaryml/baml
$ ./node_modules/.bin/baml-cli generate --from /path/to/my_schema.baml --target "typescript"
```

```typescript
import { b } from './baml_client'

// resume will always be a TypeScript interface of type Resume
const resume = await b.ExtractResume(`
  Vaibhav Gupta
  vbv@boundaryml.com
  - Founder @ BoundaryML
`);

// BAML will automatically validate the response via SAP and cast it to a TypeScript interface
```

### Ruby
```bash
$ gem install baml
$ baml-cli generate --from /path/to/my_schema.baml --target "ruby/sorbet"
```

```ruby
require 'baml_client'

# resume will always be a Sorbet model of type Resume
resume = b.ExtractResume(<<~TEXT)
  Vaibhav Gupta
  vbv@boundaryml.com
  - Founder @ BoundaryML
TEXT

# BAML will automatically validate the response via SAP and cast it to a Sorbet model
```

## Does this really matter since models will get better?

I think one could make an arguement for no. If models get better, then JSON mode will be sufficient.<br/><br/>But I personally think performance always matters. If I had some technique that can get the same quality 50% faster or 50% cheaper, then I would obviously use it. Besides, as models get better, I would much rather they spend their training data on being better at understanding the world, rather than understanding my schema. The schema part we can solve with engineering.


## Mandatory Blurb 🤝

Our mission at Boundary is to provide the best possible developer experience for shipping AI pipelines. We started with BAML, our new programming language for providing a <i>boundary</i> between stochastic AI models, and deterministic, type-safe code.

What's next? Likely we'll be showing off demos of how to combine function calling and structured generation with SAP to get the best of both worlds. Stay tuned!
