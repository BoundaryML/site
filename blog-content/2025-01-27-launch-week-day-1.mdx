## VS Code LLM Playground 2.0

One of the core philosophies behind BAML has always been to provide an unmatched developer experience for building AI applications.
Unlike a lot of backend code, AI applications are highly dynamic — in some ways they are much more similar to frontend development.

Frontend Development:
1. You change your React Component.
2. You press save.
3. Your frontend hot-reloads to show the new UI.
4. If you don't like it, go back to Step 1.

AI Development:
1. Construct a prompt.
2. See the prompt.
3. Construct test cases.
4. Write evals.
5. Run the test cases.
6. If you're not happy, go back to Step 1.


Let's take a look at what's now possible right in VSCode. Or check them out online at [promptfiddle.com](http://promptfiddle.com).

**You can see the prompt as you type it out:**
<Video src="/launchweekAssets/day1-prompt.mp4" />

**Multimodality works even better with BAML.** See how easy it is to preview and run a test that uses images! Works with audio inputs as well.

<Video src="/launchweekAssets/day1-multimodal.mp4" />

For maximum transparency, **you can see the HTTP request BAML is making** on your behalf. There's no guess work.

<Video src="/launchweekAssets/day1-raw-curl.mp4" />

You can also **view test history**, and see changes between test runs highlighted in the results:

<Video src="/launchweekAssets/day1-history.mp4" />

**Evals are 100 times easier** when you can **see what failed** and **what needs human review**:

<Video src="/launchweekAssets/day1-test-panel.mp4" />

The best of the playground is that it works with *your types* and with any LLM. **No need to copy paste JSON blobs around.**

This is only possible because BAML is the only programming language which has an `llm` as a primitive. And since BAML **plugs natively into every existing language** (python, typescript, ruby, java, php, etc), you can use it with any code base and take advantage of a completely new developer experience today.

## Try BAML Today

If you want to try BAML online (without any installs), visit [promptfiddle.com](http://promptfiddle.com) (Yes, we made a full online editor just so you could try BAML!)

If you're ready to experience BAML fully and start using LLMs faster and more reliably than ever before, go on over to our docs to get started today - [BAML Guide](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/introduction/what-is-baml)

Come back for tomorrow's post to see how migrating to BAML will take less than 3 minutes…

(And if you can't wait that long, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/yzaTpQ3tdT) community if you have any questions or just want to learn more about BAML!)
