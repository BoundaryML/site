## Roadmap to BAML 1.0

We're wrapping up Launch Week with a peek at where BAML is headed in 2025. This isn't just about ticking boxes on a feature list; it's about setting a foundation for how you'll build the next generation of intelligent applications (dare I sayâ€¦ agents ðŸ˜¬).

### 2024 Recap

As we reflect on the past year, we want to extend our deepest gratitude to the BAML community. None of this would have been possible without you!

    **Quick Stats:**
    - **GitHub**: 8 â†’ 2,000+ stars
    - **Active developers**: 10 â†’ 1,000+
    - **Discord**: 12 â†’ 700+ members
    - **Core team**: 2 â†’ 7 engineers
    - **Lines of Code**: 400k+ lines written

**More Awesome Highlights:**
- **Weekly Releases**: We've shipped fast and often, with a Rust core powering everything.
- **BAML's SAP + GPT-3.5 beat out GPT-4o + Structured outputs:** SAP (schema-aligned parsing) was novel research, and it works even better than expected. ðŸ¤¯
- **VS Code Playground:** We've built the first and only VS Code LLM playground.
- **Universal LLM Support**: Closed-source, open-sourceâ€”if it's an LLM, BAML speaks its language.
- **Language Support:** We committed to Tier 1 support for 3 languages (Python, Typescript, and Ruby) and Tier 3 for almost everything else. BAML is being used with over 10 languages, including TypeScript, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Java, Go, PHP, and Erlang.
- **Reliability:** When OpenAI went down, BAML customers didn't, because BAML makes fallbacks easy.

### 2025 Vision: Getting to BAML 1.0

**What does a 1.0 release look like?** In short, it's not just about new features. It's about making sure that every part of BAMLâ€”from the developer experience to the runtime performanceâ€”is rock-solid, intuitive, and ready for prime time.

Here's our **roadmap**:

1. **Open & Free**
    - BAML will remain open-source, free to use, and have **zero** mandatory internet dependencies.
2. **Ubiquity**
    - **Tier 1 Support** for all major languages and editors.
    - Seamless integration with popular frameworks (Next.js, React, FastAPI, etc.).
    - Simplified Cloud Deployments (AWS, GCP, Azure, Serverless, SST, Next.js).
    - **Why it matters:** Whether you're deploying a hobby project or an enterprise app, BAML just works.
3. **Complete Flexibility**
    - Fine-grained control over *when* and *how* you invoke any model.
    - Smart Model Selection: Route traffic to the best-fit model automatically.
    - **Why it matters:** You can optimize performance and cost without having to juggle multiple tools or pipelines.
4. **Scale for Teams**
    - Native version management. `baml-cli update --version $version`
    - First-class support for monorepos and multi-BAML projects.
    - A dedicated BAML formatter.
    - Modules, namespaces, and a built-in package manager.
    - **Why it matters:** As your team grows, you can keep your BAML projects organized, consistent, and easy to maintain.
5. **Novel Paradigms**
    - **Semantic Streaming**: Stream responses in a *semantically* meaningful way, not just token-by-token.
    - **Structured Evals & Observability**: Built-in logs and metrics to see why a generation turned out a certain way.
    - **Automatic Prompt/Model Updates**: Type definitions and function calls become data to tune and improve future prompts.
    - **Agentic Code**: Easily build multi-agent systems with clarity and type safety.
    - **Why it matters:** BAML goes beyond "just another LLM wrapper" by unlocking patterns you can't replicate elsewhere.
6. **Extensibility**
    - Transparent architecture so you can understand how BAML works under the hood.
    - Freedom to build your own tooling and custom integrations on top of BAML that others can use.
    - **Why it matters:** Our biggest wins have come from community-driven ideas and solutions. We want to keep that door open.
7. **Open Process**
    - A formal BAML RFC (Request for Comments) process, letting developers propose language features, runtime behaviors, or library integrations.
    - **Why it matters:** We believe BAML should be shaped by the developers who actually use it.

### The Next Era of AI Development

Our path to 1.0 is all about stabilizing, clarifying, and pushing boundaries. We want to keep working hand-in-hand with a vibrant community of developers who see LLMs as core building blocks of modern software, not just fancy add-ons.

Thank you for joining us on this journey. We're incredibly excited about what's next and can't wait to see what you'll build!
