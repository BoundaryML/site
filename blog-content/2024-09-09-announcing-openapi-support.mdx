With today's release of BAML 0.55.0, we're excited to announce that BAML now
supports Golang, Java, PHP, Ruby, Rust, and any language which you might want to
use. [Check it out here!][quickstart]

[quickstart]: https://docs.boundaryml.com/docs/get-started/quickstart/openapi

## What is BAML?

BAML is an open-source programming language that combines a great developer
experience - live preview, IDE integration, first-class tests - with [new
techniques][schema-aligned parsing] to make it easy to get structured output
out of LLMs.

[docs]: https://docs.boundaryml.com

## How do you support all languages?

For any BAML function you define, you can now

1. expose that function over an HTTP/RESTful interface, and
2. call it using an OpenAPI-generated client in the language of your choice.

And, of course, it's all 100% local, so you retain control over your prompts and
data models.

## Show me an example!

Developers define two key primitives in BAML: prompts and output schemas. For
example, to define an `ExtractReceipt` function that asks GPT4o to extract a
receipt from an image:

```baml
class Receipt {
  date string @description("ISO8601 formatted date")
  total int @description("The total amount of the receipt")
  items Item[] @description("The items on the receipt")
}

function ExtractReceipt(receipt: image) -> Receipt {
    client "openai/gpt-4o"
    prompt ...
}
```

You can now start a BAML server to expose this function over HTTP:

```bash
npx @boundaryml/baml dev --preview --from baml_src/
```

which you can `curl` to get a parsed `Receipt`:

```bash
$ curl -X POST localhost:2024/call/ExtractReceipt \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"receipt": {"url": "https://i.redd.it/adzt4bz4llfc1.jpeg"}}'
{
  "establishment_name": "Brasa Rotisserie",
  "date": "2024-01-27T20:50:00",
  "total": 24,
  "currency": "USD",
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "Roasted Pork & Over Easy Egg Bowl",
      "price": 15.25,
      "quantity": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "Indeed Mex Honey Lite",
      "price": 6.5,
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

If you've followed the [quickstart guide][quickstart], the development server will
also automatically generate an OpenAPI client for you in the language of your choosing.

We've added example projects that demonstrate this for Golang, Java, PHP, Ruby,
and Rust in our [`baml-examples`
repo](https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml-examples), but to save you a click,
we've also included snippets here:

#### Golang

```go
imageUrl := "https://i.redd.it/adzt4bz4llfc1.jpeg"
req := baml.ExtractReceiptRequest{
  Receipt: baml.BamlImage{
    BamlImageUrl: &baml.BamlImageUrl{
      Url: imageUrl,
    },
  },
}
resp, _, err := b.ExtractReceipt(context.Background()).ExtractReceiptRequest(req).Execute()
if err != nil {
  log.Printf("Error when calling ExtractReceipt: %v\n", err)
} else {
  log.Printf("ExtractReceipt Response: %v\n", resp)
}
```

#### Java

```java
var image = new BamlImage(new BamlImageUrl().url("https://i.redd.it/adzt4bz4llfc1.jpeg"));
var req = new ExtractReceiptRequest().receipt(image);
var resp = b.extractReceipt(req);
System.out.println(resp);
```

#### PHP

```php
$image = new BamlImage();
$image->setUrl("https://i.redd.it/adzt4bz4llfc1.jpeg");
$req = new ExtractReceiptRequest();
$req->setReceipt($image);
$resp = $apiInstance->extractReceipt($req);
echo "<pre> ExtractReceipt: " . print_r($resp, true) . "</pre>";
```

#### Ruby

```ruby
image = BamlClient::BamlImageUrl.new(url: 'https://i.redd.it/adzt4bz4llfc1.jpeg')
req = BamlClient::ExtractReceiptRequest.new(receipt: image)
resp = b.extract_receipt(req)
puts resp
```

#### Rust

```rust
let image = BamlImage::BamlImageUrl(BamlImageUrl {
    url: "https://i.redd.it/adzt4bz4llfc1.jpeg".to_string(),
    media_type: None,
});
let req = ExtractReceiptRequest { receipt: image };
let resp = b::extract_receipt(&config, req).await?;
dbg!(resp);
```
