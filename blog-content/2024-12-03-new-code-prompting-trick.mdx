Some of you may remember Aider's [benchmark results][aider-codegen-benchmark]
from a few months ago, where they showed that LLMs are better at codegen when
doing it in plaintext rather than JSON.

While we were working on some new features, we had an idea: what if BAML allowed
users to embed Markdown code blocks in their JSON outputs? Would that solve the
quality drop issue?

So we built it! As of BAML 0.68.0, if an LLM returns this:

```
{
  ts: ```typescript
const { execSync } = require('child_process');

function getMainBranch(): string {
    ...
}```,

  ruby: ```ruby
def get_main_branch
    ...
end```
}
```

the BAML runtime will parse this as:


```json
{
  "ts": "const { execSync } = require('child_process'); [...]",
  "ruby": "def get_main_branch [...]"
}
```

Imagine what you could do with this! You wouldn't have to write your own
markdown parsers, or manual heuristics to search for XML tags to delimit
code blocks. You could also nest code blocks deep within a JSON structure,
and do something like the above, where you ask the LLM to generate code
in multiple languages in the same prompt, and have your output just work.

We haven't had a chance to run this through any benchmarks yet, but we'd love to
hear from anyone who tries it out!
