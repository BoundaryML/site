## Beyond Strings: Type System for LLMs with BAML

Imagine if you could guarantee the shape of every response you get from a language model. No more parsing messy strings, no more unpredictable outputs. With BAML, that's no longer a dream; it's our new reality.

Many of you are already familiar with the power of structured prompting — the idea that specifying the format of LLM output significantly improves downstream reliability and user experiences. If you're new to this, think of it as designing a conversation where you precisely define what you expect to get back.

**Let's see this in action.** Look at the recipe for one of my favorite dishes — saag paneer.

<Video src="/launchweekAssets/day3-recipie-structured-vs-chat.mp4" />

In the example on the left, we're using a general-purpose LLM, and ask it to return any string in natural language. It gives back a recipe that we can use but nothing about it is guaranteed. On the right, same model, but using BAML's type system — will **always** return the data in a shape that our frontend can consume.

The difference is clear: One is freeform, and the other is highly predictable.

As your prompting pipelines become more sophisticated, so does the need for reliability and structure. Our latest release of BAML allows you to build **rock-solid LLM interactions** by leveraging a purpose-built type system.

We've moved beyond asking language models in plain English. By leveraging types we gain a few specifications:

- **Unambiguous Communication:** Types are much less vague than natural language.
- **Efficiency:** Types offer a more compact token representation.
- **Clarity:** Types are far easier to read and understand, making your code more maintainable.
- **Debugging:** With types, it's easier to spot inconsistencies and debug.
- **Consistency:** Type compilers will catch a lot of unexpected bugs before they reach production.

While type systems may require more upfront design and are less flexible than free-form text, their maintainability, reliability, and clarity far outweigh these limitations. We believe this is a worthwhile trade-off.

### Introducing BAML's Powerful Type System

BAML's type system now supports a comprehensive set of features, designed specifically for language models:

- [**Primitives**](https://docs.boundaryml.com/ref/baml/types#primitive-types): string, float, int, bool, literal, null
- [**Composite**](https://docs.boundaryml.com/ref/baml/types#compositestructured-types): map&lt;k, v&gt;, list&lt;v&gt;
- **User-defined**: classes, enums
- **Recursive types**
- [**Type aliases**](https://docs.boundaryml.com/ref/baml/types#type-aliases)

```java
// You can literally define any type in BAML (including arbitrary JSON).
type JSON = string | int | float | null | JSON[] | map<string, JSON>;
```

- @alias to rename fields for the LLM without affecting your data storage. For example, use `establishment_name` for the LLM but consume it as `name` in a database or UI Components.

```baml
class Invoice {
   name string @alias("establishment_name")
}
```

- @assert to add runtime metadata validations, ensuring data integrity.

```baml
class Resume {
  // if the LLM gives an empty this,
  // this is not a valid name or Resume
  name string @assert(not_empty, {{ this|length > 0 }})
  education string[]
}
```

or

```baml
type NonEmptyString = string @assert(not_empty, {{ this|length > 0 }})

class Resume {
  name NonEmptyString
  education string[]
}
```

- @check to plumb metadata validations, letting you know if a response isn't valid:

```baml
class Contact {
   name string
   email string @assert(valid_email, {{ this|regex_matches(".+@.+\..+") }}) @check(not_gmail, {{ !this|regex_matches(".+@gmail.com") }})
}
```

```typescript
// BAML transforms the above into this in Typescript and returns the computed @check
// values in the response
interface Contact {
  name: string
  email: {
    value: string
    checks: {
      not_gmail: boolean
    }
  }
}
```

or even cleaner

```baml
type ValidEmail = string @assert(valid_email, {{ this|regex_matches(".+@.+\..+") }})
type NotGmail = ValidEmail @check(not_gmail, {{ !this|regex_matches(".+@gmail.com") }})

class Contact {
  name string
  // alias to work_email for the llm
  email NotGmail @alias("work_email")
}
```

- [**Dynamic Types**](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/baml-advanced/dynamic-runtime-types): Create types at runtime based on user input or external data, for example, a list of colors loaded from a database.

```baml
// BAML code
class ColorCategory {
 @@dynamic
}

function GetMoodColor(text: string) -> ColorCategory {
  client "openai/gpt-4o"
  prompt #"..."#
}
```

```python
# Python code

valid_categories = ["red", "blue", ...]
tb = TypeBuilder()
for value in valid_categories:
  tb.ColorCategory.add_value(value).alias(value.upper())
# Call the baml function
result = b.GetMoodColor("I'm feeling sad", { "tb": tb})

# this will always be true!
assert result in valid_categories
```

### Real-World Example

Let's look at a real use case from one of our users: **Invoice Processing**.

**Instead of this:**

```
You are an expert accountant, extract all the line items from this invoice.

EXTRACT EVERY ITEM. DO NOT SKIP.
Track the quantity and unit price and total for each item.
Extract any fees applied.

Here is the user's invoice.
{{ invoice_content }}
```

**You can do this:**

```baml
class Invoice {
 items Item[]
 subtotal float
 fees map<string, float>
 tax float
 total float
}

class Item {
 description string
 quantity float
 unit_price float
 total float
}

prompt:
Parse an Invoice.

{{ invoice_content }}
```

Notice how **concise** and **easy to understand** the later approach is using type systems!

If you're ready to experience BAML fully and start using LLMs faster and more reliably than ever before, go on over to our docs to get started today - [BAML Guide](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/introduction/what-is-baml)

But that's not all! We're not slowing down! Tomorrow, prepare for an even bigger update to our type system. It will redefine the way you think about Agentic UX, and you don't want to miss it.

(You might even get a sneak peek of people already talking about it in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/yzaTpQ3tdT) community!)
