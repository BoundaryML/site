Here at BoundaryML, we've spent the past year building [BAML], a new programming
language, with the goal of making it easy for developers to work with LLMs. We
wanted to talk a bit about the engineering involved in this process (we'll discuss
how we ideate on syntax in a future post).

[BAML]: https://docs.boundaryml.com

## Why make a language?

For argument's sake, let's assume we've agreed that building a new language is a good idea.

## Requirements

At a minimum, users need to be able to:

    - install it,
    - write some code, and
    - run it.

In addition, users also expect all of the following:

    - a way to try it out without installing it
    - easy-to-understand, actionable error messages
    - a community: a place to ask questions and provide feedback
    - IDE integration
        - syntax highlighting
        - inline diagnostics
        - jump-to-definition
        - autocomplete

BAML also isn't a general-purpose programming language, which
means that we have one more critical requirement:

    - interop with the languages our users write their software in (e.g. Python,
        TypeScript, Ruby)

This is by no means an exhaustive list (e.g. a standard library, toolchain
manager, package manager, and package registry), but it's what we've started
with.

### Open-source and free

We also believe that making a language open-source, and committing to keeping
keeping our toolchain open-source and freely available, is a core requirement
for success.

That's why all the BAML source code is available on [GitHub][baml-github] and
licensed using Apache 2.0.

[baml-github]: https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml

## What we've built

Requirements are nice and all, but that doesn't say a lot about the actual
engineering work involved in satisfying these tasks.

### Choosing Rust ðŸ¦€

Building BAML in Python or Typescript was a no-go for us. Since we need BAML to
be able to interface with any language, we need to provide a bare-bones [foreign
function interface (FFI)][ffi] for each language we support, so we had to use
something more low-level.

[ffi]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface

We wrote our first compiler in C++, but we've since migrated to Rust (even
though we didn't know any Rust when we started). Here's a few reasons why:

    - Running a team with maintainable C++ code is hard
    - It's hype ðŸš€
    - You can design your code such that if it compiles, it's probably correct
    - We didn't have to start from scratch, and were able to use the [Prisma]
        implementation as a great reference for directory structure and organization
    - We first thought that it wouldn't take more than 4 days to port our C++
        code to Rust. It ended up taking 6 weeks ðŸ¤¡

[Prisma]: https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines

Other benefits we later discovered:

    - There's a package for everything in Rust
    - The UX in VSCode is great for writing _and_ testing Rust (this actually inspired the way we thought about testing in BAML)
    - Learning Rust is much easier with the help of tools like Github Copilot

### BAML itself: a compiler, runtime, and CLI

To implement our compiler:

    - we use a [Pest grammar] to lex the source code (inspired by [Prisma][pest-prisma]),
    - we do a [first compiler pass to build an abstract syntax tree
        (AST)][baml-ast], where we
        - resolve symbols and types,
        - collect diagnostics for malformed syntax trees (e.g. a partially-defined function), and
        - once we've verified the syntax tree is well-formed, we [build an
            intermediate representation (IR)][baml-ir][^ir],
    - we then do a second compiler pass using the IR to
        - apply static analysis to our template expansion on [jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) (we use [minijinja] for
            our templates, and built our own type checking using its exposed AST), and
        - (optionally) [generate types and bindings] in our target languages (Python,
            TypeScript, Ruby) for the types and functions that our users have
            defined in BAML.

Once users generate bindings for their BAML functions, they can call those bindings,
which then calls into the BAML runtime:

    - we use [pyo3] to expose our runtime in Python;
    - we use [napi-rs] to expose our runtime in Node.js; (highly recommend napi-rs over [neon](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon))
    - we use [magnus] and [rb-sys] to expose our runtime in Ruby; and
    - we use [wasm-bindgen] to expose our runtime in WASM, for use in the VSCode extension and browser.

We use these same techniques to expose `baml-cli` in each target environment - the per-language
customization is just how we retrieve `argv` (c.f. the [Python
implementation][python-cli-impl]) - which allows us to guarantee the same
behavior in each environment.

[^ir]: The distinction between an AST, IR, or any other flavor (e.g. Rust MIR, LLVM LLIR) is
    somewhat arbitrary and tends to just reflect the abstractions used by a given compiler;
    our distinction, right now, is that we guarantee our IR is well-formed but we make no such
    guarantee for our AST.


### An installer

Since BAML isn't a general-purpose programming language, and is meant to be used via
interop with user's preferred languages - e.g. Python, TypeScript, Ruby - we can rely on
the package registries of those languages to distribute our compiler, runtime, and CLI.

(If this wasn't the case, we'd need to ship at least a portable installer script, like
[Docker does][docker-install-script], or our own `apt` and `brew` sources.)

[docker-install-script]: https://github.com/docker/docker-install

### A way to try it out without installing it

This is [promptfiddle.com](https://promptfiddle.com), which is implemented using:

    - [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/), to provide IDE-like features (we considered Monaco, but wanted to
        keep as much of the logic in-browser as possible, and were inspired by
        [repl.it's bet][repl-it-codemirror])
    - a [Lezer grammar for BAML], to back the syntax highlighting
    - our own in-memory file tree, to provide an IDE-like experience
    - a WASM build of our compiler and runtime, to provide real-time inline diagnostics

[Lezer grammar for BAML]: https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml/blob/73cf36d0d5930e52b4914bbba0299835060a2a03/typescript/codemirror-lang-baml/src/syntax.grammar
[repl-it-codemirror]: https://blog.replit.com/codemirror

### IDE integration

We provide IDE integration using a [VSCode extension][baml-vscode]:

    - a [TextMate grammar] powers syntax highlighting (if you're keeping count, yes, that's
        three different BAML grammars)
    - the extension is [implemented in TypeScript][baml-vscode-impl], and uses
        `vscode-languageclient` to communicate with the language server
    - the language server (also [implemented in TypeScript][baml-lsp-impl][^ide-lsp-napi])
        provides diagnostics, jump-to-definition, and autocomplete[^ide-autocomplete], and is
        implemented using `vscode-languageserver` and the WASM bindings to the
        BAML compiler; and
    - a React app in a [VSCode webview] powers the in-VSCode playground, which
        allows users to run individual BAML functions interactively.

[^ide-autocomplete]: We've only actually implemented autocomplete suggestions for one specific
case so far; doing it more generally is on our to-do list.
[^ide-lsp-napi]: We considered using the NAPI-RS bindings to the BAML compiler - we know
it's possible to [ship VSCode extensions with native
dependencies][native-bindings-vscode], but we were concerned about how much work
we'd have to put into making our NAPI-RS bindings build for
[Electron][native-bindings-electron].

### Documentation

Our documentation is currently hosted on Mintlify, and is written using MDX (Markdown-React).

The current way we've broken down [docs.boundaryml.com](https://docs.boundaryml.com) is to have sections for:

    - quickstart,
    - language tutorials,
    - usage tutorials (i.e. how to actually call BAML functions from your Python/TypeScript/Ruby code), and
    - reference documentation.

We'll likely have to migrate soon, though, because Mintlify doesn't support custom
syntax highlighting and has no plans to do so.

### Community

We provide a [Discord server](https://docs.boundaryml.com/discord) where users
can ask questions and provide feedback in real-time, which is the primary way we
engage with our community. (We would offer a community Slack, except Slack has
no community pricing.)

Lately, we've also had users engage with us via GitHub Issues and Discussions
(we've set up Slack notification bridges for these), as well as on Hacker News
and Reddit - we recognize that we need to meet our users where they are.


## More to come!

We'll dive more into the details of all this in the next posts.
