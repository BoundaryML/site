Qwen recently released [QwQ-32B](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwq-32b/), their latest reasoning-focused model that excels at structured outputs and function calling. QwQ-32B is built on top of Qwen2.5 and brings significant improvements in reasoning capabilities, making it particularly well-suited for complex tasks requiring structured outputs.

[BAML](https://boundaryml.com) is our prompting framework that makes it easy to work with function calling across any LLM. Let's explore how to use QwQ-32B with BAML for some practical examples.

## How to use QwQ-32B with BAML

Let's look at an interactive example that showcases QwQ's strong reasoning capabilities!

### Complex Classification with QwQ
First, we'll write some BAML code to handle a more complex classification task that requires reasoning. QwQ is particularly good at understanding context and making nuanced decisions.

<BamlBlock name="1" bamlCode={`
client MyQwQ {
    provider openai-generic
    options {
      model "qwen/qwq-32b"
      base_url "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
    }
}

enum Priority {
    URGENT
    HIGH
    MEDIUM
    LOW
}

enum Department {
    ENGINEERING
    PRODUCT
    SALES
    SUPPORT
    OTHER
}

class TicketAnalysis {
    priority Priority
    department Department
    reasoning string @description(#"
    explanation of why this classification was chosen
         use complete sentences
    "#)
    estimated_time int @description("estimated time to resolve in hours")
}

function AnalyzeTicket(ticket_description: string) -> TicketAnalysis {
    client MyQwQ
    prompt #"
      Analyze this support ticket and classify it appropriately.
      Consider the urgency, impact, and complexity when determining priority.
      
      {{ ctx.output_format(prefix="Using this schema:\n") }}
      {{ _.role("user") }}
      {{ ticket_description }}
    "#
}

test TestUrgentCase {
    functions [AnalyzeTicket]
    args {
      ticket_description "Production database is down affecting all customer transactions. Multiple clients reporting complete service outage."
    }
    @@assert(priority, {{ this.priority == "URGENT" }})
    @@assert(department, {{ this.department == "ENGINEERING" }})
}
`}
/>

You can run this in Python like this:

```python
from baml_client import b
response = b.AnalyzeTicket(
    ticket_description="Production database is down affecting all customer transactions."
)
print(f"Priority: {response.priority}")
print(f"Department: {response.department}")
print(f"Reasoning: {response.reasoning}")
print(f"Est. Time: {response.estimated_time} hours")
```

### Multi-Tool Reasoning with QwQ
One of QwQ's strengths is its ability to reason about which tool to use based on complex requirements. Here's an example with multiple possible actions:

<BamlBlock name="2" bamlCode={`
client MyQwQ {
    provider openai-generic
    options {
      model "qwen/qwq-32b"
      base_url "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
    }
}

class CreateDocument {
    title string
    content string
    access_level string @description("public, internal, or confidential")
    tags string[] @description("relevant tags for categorization")
}

class UpdatePermissions {
    document_id string
    new_access_level string
    reason string @description("justification for the permission change")
    notify_users string[] @description("users to notify about this change")
}

class ArchiveDocument {
    document_id string
    archive_reason string
    retention_period int @description("number of days to retain")
}

function HandleDocumentRequest(user_request: string) -> CreateDocument | UpdatePermissions | ArchiveDocument {
    client MyQwQ
    prompt #"
      Based on the user's request, determine the appropriate document management action.
      Consider security implications and compliance requirements.
    
      {{ ctx.output_format }}
      {{ _.role("user") }}
      {{ user_request }}
    "#
}

test TestCreateDoc {
    functions [HandleDocumentRequest]
    args {
      user_request "Please create a new internal documentation about our API rate limiting policy"
    }
}

test TestUpdatePerms {
    functions [HandleDocumentRequest]
    args {
      user_request "The security audit document needs to be changed to confidential and all team leads should be notified"
    }
}
`}
/>

You can use it in Python like this:

```python
from baml_client import b
from baml_client.types import CreateDocument, UpdatePermissions, ArchiveDocument

response = b.HandleDocumentRequest(
    user_request="Please create a new internal documentation about our API rate limiting policy"
)

if isinstance(response, CreateDocument):
    print("Creating new document:")
    print(f"Title: {response.title}")
    print(f"Access Level: {response.access_level}")
    print(f"Tags: {', '.join(response.tags)}")
elif isinstance(response, UpdatePermissions):
    print("Updating permissions:")
    print(f"Document: {response.document_id}")
    print(f"New Access Level: {response.new_access_level}")
    print(f"Reason: {response.reason}")
elif isinstance(response, ArchiveDocument):
    print("Archiving document:")
    print(f"Document: {response.document_id}")
    print(f"Retention Period: {response.retention_period} days")
```

QwQ-32B's advanced reasoning capabilities make it particularly good at:
1. Understanding complex context and requirements.
2. Making nuanced decisions between multiple options.
3. Providing detailed explanations for its choices.

That's it!
